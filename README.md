# gamings
I decided to create Fr!zzgamings.netlify.app with the "softgamings.com" website because I just love the website layouts, colors and responsiveness.

As you only learn by learning from those ahead of you, this website[softgamings.com], really helped me make use of some styling elements I'd not even used in a while trying to replicate or create a clone of other websites..


Currently working on the media queries so as to make it properly align & responsive along with various screen sizes..

I coded this site in such a way I do not really need to align the nvigations separately, whatever I work on, on the home page reflects aligns all the other navs, except I just decided to align some elements individually..
